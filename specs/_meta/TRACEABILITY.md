# Traceability Matrix

Each PRD section maps to one or more feature files. Each feature file maps back to the PRD via
its `# Trace:` block. Scenario IDs are inferred and stable (see `specs/README.md`).

## Coverage notes

- The `out of scope for v1` items in the PRD preamble are covered by the `@dormant` and negative-route scenarios in `auth_and_access/totp_dormant.feature`, `auth_and_access/role_org_dormant.feature`, `chat/chat_topup_cta_dormant.feature`, and `payments/payment_topup_dormant.feature`.
- `§12.1 Hosting`, `§12.2 Security boundaries`, and `§12.4 Availability` are environment/SRE concerns and do not produce user-observable scenarios. See COVERAGE_GAPS.md.
